# v4v_exchange

This is meant to be a page easy for me to access to quickly find out the SAT rate I want
to use when listening to podcasts.

## To Test Locally

Easy, just use the Python built-in HTTP server.

```shell
python3 -m http.server
```

## Using Docker

An AMD64 image is hosted at https://hub.docker.com/r/dalevisser/v4v-exchange.
Instructions are posted there on using it.
